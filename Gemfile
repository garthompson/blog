# Use the github-pages gem to manage Jekyll and its dependencies for GitHub Pages
# This gem will install Jekyll and other common dependencies like jekyll-feed, jekyll-seo-tag, jekyll-sitemap, and jekyll-remote-theme.
gem 'github-pages', group: :jekyll_plugins

# If you have other plugins not included in github-pages, you can add them here.
# For example:
# gem 'another-jekyll-plugin'

# The following gems are typically handled by the 'github-pages' gem or not strictly necessary for a basic setup.
# If you encounter issues or need specific versions, you can uncomment and manage them explicitly.
# gem 'jekyll', '~> 4.2.0' # Or the version compatible with github-pages
# gem 'jekyll-feed', '~> 0.15.0'
# gem 'jekyll-seo-tag', '~> 2.7.0'
# gem 'sassc-rails', '~> 2.1.2' # For Sass compilation, often handled by Jekyll's built-in Sass support or github-pages

# The theme is specified using `remote_theme` in _config.yml, so it's not needed here.
# gem "jekyll-theme-swiss" # Or whatever the gem name is, if you were to install it locally
